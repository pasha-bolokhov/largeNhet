{\large\bf Abstract}
\end{center}
We address a number of unanswered questions on the \nzt deformation of the \cpn model with
twisted masses.  In particular, we
complete the program of solving \cpn model with twisted masses in the large-$N$
limit. In hep-th/0512153 nonsupersymmetric version of the model with the $Z_N$
symmetric twisted masses was analyzed in the framework of Witten's method. In arXiv:0803.0698 
this analysis was extended: we presented the 
large-$N$ solution of the heterotic \nzt \cpn model with no twisted masses.
Here we solve the heterotic \nzt \mbox{\cpn}  model with nonvanishing twisted
masses. Dynamical scenarios at large and small $m$ are studied
($m$ is the twisted mass scale).
In a certain limiting case we discuss the mirror representation for the heterotic model.

\section{Introduction}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

Two-dimensional  CP$(N-1)$ models with twisted masses
emerged as effective low-energy theories on
the worldsheet of non-Abelian strings in a class of 
four-dimensional \ntwo\, gauge theories with unequal (s)quark 
masses~\cite{HT1,ABEKY,SYmon,HT2} (for reviews see  \cite{Trev}). 
Deforming these models in various ways (i.e. breaking supersymmetry down to \none and to nothing)
one arrives at nonsupersymmetric or heterotic \cpn models.\footnote{
Strictly speaking, the full derivation of the
heterotic \cpn model with twisted masses, valid for arbitrary values of
the deformation parameters,  from the microscopic bulk theory, is still absent.
However, at small values of the deformation parameters,
such a derivation is quite straightforward.} These two-dimensional models are very 
interesting on their own,
since they exhibit nontrivial dynamics with or without phase transitions 
as one varies the twisted mass scale.
In this paper we will present the large-$N$ solution of the \nzt \mbox{\cpn}  model with twisted
masses. As a warm up exercise we analyze this model in the limit of vanishing heterotic deformation,
i.e. the \ntt \cpn model with twisted masses (at $N\to\infty$). Both solutions 
that we report here are based on the method developed by Witten
\cite{W79,W93} (see also \cite{dadvl}) and extended in \cite{SYhet} to include the heterotic deformation.
For certain purposes we find it convenient to invoke the mirror
representation \cite{MR1,MR2}. An \nzt \cpn$\times C$
model on the string world sheet in the bulk theory deformed by $\mu\ca^2$
was suggested by Edalati and Tong \cite{EdTo}.
It was derived from the bulk theory in \cite{SY1} (see also \cite{BSY1,BSY2}).
Finally, the heterotic \nzt  \cpn model with twisted masses was formulated in \cite{BSY3}.

\section{Generalities}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

\ntt supersymmtric \cpn sigma model was originally constructed 
\cite{orco}
in terms of \none superfields. Somewhat later it was realized \cite{Bruno}
that 
\none supersymmetry is automatically elevated up to \ntwo
provided the target manifold of the sigma model in question is K\"ahlerian (for reviews see \cite{rev1,rev2}).
The Witten index \cite{WI} of the \cpn model is $N$, implying unbroken supersymmetry
and $N$ degenerate vacua at zero energy density.
The \cpn manifold is compact; therefore, superpotential is impossible.
One can introduce mass terms, however, through the twisted masses \cite{twisted}.
The model is asymptotically free \cite{BelPo}, a dynamical scale $\Lambda$ is generated through dimensional transmutation. If the scale of the twisted masses is much larger than $\Lambda$, the theory is at weak coupling.
Otherwise it is at strong coupling. A priori, there are $N$ distinct twisted mass parameters.
However, in the absence of the heterotic deformation one of them is unobservable
(see below). In this case the model is characterized by the coupling constant $g^2$,
the vacuum angle $\theta$ and the twisted mass parameters $m_1,\,m_2,\, ..., m_N$
with the constraint
\beq
m_1 + m_2 + ... +m_N =0\,.
\label{one}
\eeq
Introducing a heterotic deformation, generally speaking, we eliminate the above constraint.
The twisted masses are arbitrary complex parameters. Of special interest 
in some instances (for example, in studying possible phase transitions)
is the $Z_N$ symmetric choice
\beq
m_k = m\exp\left(\frac{2\pi \,i\, k}{N}\right)\,,\qquad k = 0,1,2, ... ,N-1\,.
\label{two}
\eeq
The set (\ref{two}) will be referred to as the $Z_N$-symmetric masses.
Then the constraint
(\ref{one}) is automatically satisfied. Without loss of generality $m$ can be assumed
to be real and positive. 

Where necessary, we mark the bare coupling constant by the subscript 0 and introduce
the inverse parameter $\beta$ as follows:
\beq
\beta = \frac{1}{g_0^2}\,.
\eeq
At large $N$, in the 't Hooft limit,  the parameter $\beta$ scales as $N$.

There are two equivalent languages commonly used in description of the \cpn model:
the geometric language ascending to \cite{Bruno} (see also \cite{rev2}), and the
so-called gauged formulation ascending to \cite{W79,W93}. Both have their convenient and less convenient sides.
We will discuss both formulations although construction of the $1/N$ expansion is
more convenient within the framework of the gauged formulation. At $|m|/\Lambda \to 0$
the elementary fields of the
gauged formulation (they form an  $N$-plet) are in one-to-one correspondence with the kinks in the geometric formulation.
The multiplicity of kinks -- the fact they they enter in $N$-plets --
can be readily established \cite{adam} using the mirror representation \cite{MR1}. We will discuss this in more detail
later. 

\section{The model}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

\subsection{Gauged formulation, no heterotic deformation}

In this section we will briefly review the gauged formulation \cite{W79,W93} of
the \mbox{\ntt} \cpn model with twisted masses
\cite{twisted}, i.e. we set the heterotic deformation coupling
$\gamma = 0$.
This formulation is built on an $N$-plet of complex scalar fields $n^i$ where $i=1,2,...,N$.
We impose the constraint
\beq
\bar n_i \,n^i = 2\beta \,.
\eeq
This leaves us with $2N-1$ real bosonic degrees of freedom. To eliminate one extra degree
of freedom we impose a local U(1) invariance $n^i(x)\to e^{i\alpha(x)} n^i(x)$.
To this end we introduce a gauge field $A_\mu$ which converts the partial derivative into the
covariant one,
\beq
\partial_\mu\to \nabla_\mu \equiv \partial_\mu -i\,  A_\mu\,.
\eeq
The field $A_\mu$ is auxiliary; it enters in the Lagrangian without derivatives. The kinetic term of the
$n$ fields is
\beq
\cell  = \left|\nabla_\mu n^i\right|^2\,.
\eeq
The superpartner to the field $n^i$ is an $N$-plet of complex two-component spinor fields $\xi^i$,
\beq
\xi^i =\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\xi^i_R\\[2mm]
\xi^i_L
\end{array}
\right.\,,
\eeq
subject to the constraint
\beq
\bar{n}_i\,\xi^i =0\,,\qquad \bar\xi_i\,n^i = 0\,.
\label{npxi}
\eeq
Needless to say, the auxiliary field $A_\mu$ has a complex scalar superpartner $\sigma$ 
and a two-component complex spinor superpartner $\lambda$; both enter without derivatives.
The full \ntt-symmetric Lagrangian is\,\footnote{This is, obviously, the Euclidean version.}
\beqn
\cell &=& 
\frac{1}{e_0^2}\left(\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^2 +\left|\pt_\mu\sigma\right|^2 + \frac{1}{2}D^2
+\bar\lambda \, i\bar{\sigma}^\mu\pt_\mu\,\lambda
\right) + i\,D\left(\bar{n}_i n^i -2\beta
\right)
\nonumber\\[3mm]
&+&
\left|\nabla_\mu n^i\right|^2+ \bar{\xi}_i\, i\bar{\sigma}^\mu\nabla_\mu\,\xi^i
+ 2\sum_i\left|\sigma-\frac{m_i}{\sqrt 2}\right|^2\, |n^i|^2
\nonumber\\[3mm]
&+&
i\sqrt{2}\,\sum_i \left( \sigma -\frac{m_i}{\sqrt 2}\right)\bar\xi_{Ri}\, \xi^i_L +i\sqrt{2}\,\bar{n}_i
\left(\lambda_R\xi^i_L - \lambda_L\xi^i_R
\right)
\nonumber\\
&+&
i\sqrt{2}\,\sum_i \left( \bar\sigma -\frac{\bar{m}_i}{\sqrt 2}\right)\bar\xi_{Li}\, \xi^i_R +i\sqrt{2}\,{n}^i
\left(\lambda_L\bar\xi_{Ri} - \lambda_R\bar\xi_{Li}
\right),
\label{bee31}
\eeqn
where $m_i$ are twisted mass parameters, and the limit $e_0^2\to\infty$ is implied. 
\marginpar{\tiny Znak poslednih chlenov v dvuh poslednih
strochkah ne sovpapadet s Pashey!}
Moreover,
\beq
\bar\sigma^\mu = \{1,\,i\sigma_3\}\,,
\label{wtpi3}
\eeq
see Appendix A.

It is clearly seen that the auxiliary field $\sigma$
enters in (\ref{bee31}) only through the  combination
\beq
\sigma -\frac{m_i}{\sqrt 2}\,.
\label{combi}
\eeq
By an appropriate shift of $\sigma$
one can always redefine the twisted mass parameters in such a way that the constraint
(\ref{one}) is satisfied.
The U(1) gauge symmetry is built in. This symmetry eliminates one bosonic degree of freedom, leaving us with $2N-2$ dynamical bosonic degrees of freedom inherent to CP$(N-1)$ model.



\subsection{Geometric formulation, \boldmath{$\tilde\gamma=0$} }

Here we will  briefly review the \ntt supersymmetric \cpn models in the
geometric formulation. 
The target space is the $N-1$-dimensional K\"ahler manifold 
parametrized by the fields $\phi^{i},\,\phi^{\dagger\,\bar j}$, $\,i,\bar j=1,\ldots,N-1$,
which are the lowest components of the chiral and antichiral superfields 
\beq
\Phi^{i}(x^{\mu}+i\bar \theta \gamma^{\mu} \theta),\qquad \bar\Phi^{\bar j}(x^{\mu}-i\bar \theta \gamma^{\mu} \theta)\,,
\label{wtpi4}
\eeq
where\,\footnote{In the Euclidean space $\bar\psi$ becomes an independent variable.}
\beqn
&&
x^{\mu}=\{t,z\},\qquad \bar \theta=\theta^{\dagger}\gamma^{0},\qquad \bar \psi=\psi^{\dagger}\gamma^{0}
\nonumber
\\[2mm]
&&\gamma^{0}=\gamma^t=\sigma_2\,,\qquad \gamma^{1}=\gamma^z = i\sigma_1\,,\qquad \gamma_{5} 
\equiv\gamma^0\gamma^1 = \sigma_3\,.
\label{wtpi5}
\eeqn
With no twisted mass the Lagrangian  is \cite{Bruno}
(see also \cite{WessBagger})
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kinetic}
{\cell}_{m=0}= \int d^{4 }\theta K(\Phi, \bar\Phi)
=G_{i\bar j} \left[\partial^\mu \bar\phi^{\,\bar j}\, \partial_\mu\phi^{i}
+i\bar \psi^{\bar j} \gamma^{\mu} \cde_{\mu}\psi^{i}\right]
-\frac{1}{2}\,R_{i\bar jk\bar l}\,(\bar\psi^{\bar j}\psi^{i})(\bar\psi^{\bar l}\psi^{k}).
\end{equation}
\beq
G_{i\bar j}=\frac{\partial^{2} K(\phi,\,\bar\phi)}{\partial \phi^{i}\partial \bar\phi^{\,\bar j}}
\label{wtpi6}
\eeq
 is the K\"ahler metric,
$R_{i\bar jk\bar l}$ is the Riemann tensor \cite{Helgason}, 
\beq
R_{i\bar{j} k\bar{m}} = - \frac{g_0^2}{2}\left(G_{i\bar{j}}G_{k\bar{m}} +
G_{i\bar{m}}G_{k\bar{j}}
\right)\,.
\label{640}
\eeq
Moreover,
$$ \cde_{\mu}\psi^{i}=
\partial_{\mu}\psi^{i}+\Gamma^{i}_{kl}\partial_{\mu} \phi^{k}\psi^{l}
$$
is the covariant derivative.
The Ricci tensor $R_{i\bar j}$ is proportional to the metric \cite{Helgason},
\beq
\label{eq:RG}
R_{i\bar{j}} = \frac{g_{0}^2}{2}\,  N \, G_{i\bar{j}}\,.
\eeq
For the massless CP($N\!-\!1)$ model 
a particular choice of the K\"ahler potential
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kahler}
K_{m=0}=\frac{2}{g_{0}^{2}}\ln\left(1+\sum_{i,\bar j=1}^{ N-1}\bar\Phi^{\,\bar j}\delta_{\bar j i}\Phi^{i}\right)
\end{equation}
corresponds to the round Fubini--Study metric.

Let us  briefly remind how one can introduce the twisted mass parameters \cite{twisted, Dor}.
The theory (\ref{eq:kinetic}) can be interpreted as an ${\mathcal N}=1$ theory of $d$ chiral superfields 
in four dimensions.  The theory possesses $N-1$ distinct   U(1) isometries 
parametrized by $t^{a}$, $a=1,\ldots,N-1$.
The Killing vectors of the isometries can be expressed via derivatives of the Killing 
potentials $D^{a}(\phi, \bar\phi)$,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:KillD}
\frac{{d}\phi^{i}}{{  d}\,t_{a}}=-iG^{i\bar j}\,\frac{\partial D^{a}}{\partial \bar\phi^{ \,\bar j}}
\,,\qquad 
\frac{{d}\bar\phi^{ \,\bar j}}{{  d}\,t_{a}}=iG^{i\bar j}\,\frac{\partial D^{a}}{\partial \phi^{i}}\,.
\end{equation}
This defines U(1) Killing potentials, up to additive constants.

The $N -1$ isometries are
 evident from the expression (\ref{eq:kahler}) for the K\"ahler potential, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:iso}
\delta\phi^{i}=-i\delta t_{a} (T^{a})^{i}_{k}(\phi)^{k}\,,\qquad 
\delta\bar\phi^{\,\bar j}=i\delta t_{a}(T^{a})^{\bar j}_{\bar l}\bar\phi^{\,\bar l}\,,
\qquad a=1,\ldots, N-1\,,
\end{equation}
(together with the similar variation of fermionic fields),
where the  generators $T^{a}$ have a simple diagonal form,
\begin{equation}
(T^{a})^{i}_{k}=\delta^{i}_{a}\delta^{a}_{k}\,, \qquad a=1,\ldots,N-1\,.
\end{equation}
 The explicit form of the Killing potentials $D^{a}$ in CP$(N\!-\!1)$ with the Fubini--Study metric is
\beq
\label{eq:KillF}
D^{a}=\frac{2}{g_{0}^{2}}\,\frac{\bar\phi\, T^{a}\phi}{1+\bar\phi\,\phi}\,,
\qquad a=1,\ldots,N-1\,.
\eeq
Here we use the matrix notation implying that $\phi$ is a column $\phi^{i}$ and 
$\bar\phi$ is a row $\bar\phi^{ \bar j}$.

The isometries allow us  to introduce an interaction with $N-1$ {\em external} 
U(1) gauge 
superfields $V_{a}$ by modifying, in a gauge invariant way,  the K\"ahler potential (\ref{eq:kahler}),
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mkahler}
K_{m=0}(\Phi, \bar\Phi)\to
K_{m}(\Phi, \bar\Phi,V)\,.
\end{equation}
For CP$(N\!-\!1)$ this modification takes the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mkahlerp}
K_{m}=\frac{2}{g_{0}^{2}}\ln \left(1+\bar\Phi\,{\rm e}^{V_{a}T^{a}}\Phi\right)\,.
\end{equation}
In every gauge multiplet $V_{a}$ let us retain only the $A^{a}_{x}$ and $A^{a}_{y}$ 
components of the gauge potentials taking them to be just constants,
\beq
V_{a}=-m_{a}\bar \theta(1+\gamma_{5})\theta -\bar m_{a}\bar \theta(1-\gamma_{5})\theta\,,
\label{wtpi1}
\end{equation}
where we introduced complex masses  $m_{a}$ as linear combinations of 
constant U(1) gauge potentials,
\beqn
m_{a}
&=&
A^{a}_{y}+iA^{a}_{x}\,,\qquad \bar m_{a}=m_{a}^{*}=A^{a}_{y}-iA^{a}_{x}\,,
\nonumber\\[2mm]
a 
&=&
 1,2, ..., N-1\,.
\label{wtpi2}
\eeqn
In spite  of the explicit $\theta$ dependence the introduction of masses does not 
break ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry.  One way to see this is to notice that the mass parameters 
can be viewed as the lowest components of the twisted chiral superfields
$D_{2}\bar D_{1}V_{a}$.

Now we can go back to two dimensions implying that there is no dependence
on $x$ and $y$ in the chiral fields.  It gives us the Lagrangian with the twisted masses 
included \cite{twisted, Dor}:
\beqn
\label{eq:mtwist}
{\mathcal L}_{m}
&=&
 \int d^{4 }\theta \,K_{m}(\Phi, \bar\Phi,\,V)
=G_{i\bar j}\, g_{MN}\left[ {\cde}^M \bar\phi^{\,\bar j}\, {\cde}^{N} \phi^{i}
+i\,\bar \psi^{\bar j} \gamma^{M}\,D^{N} \psi^{i}\right]
\nonumber\\[3mm]
&-&
\frac{1}{2}\,R_{i\bar jk\bar l}\,(\bar\psi^{\bar j}\psi^{i})(\bar\psi^{\bar l}\psi^{k})\,,
\eeqn
where $G_{i\bar j} =\partial_{i}\partial_{\bar j}K_{m}|_{\theta=\bar\theta=0}$ is the K\"ahler metric 
and summation over $M$ includes, besides $M=\mu=0,1$, also 
$M=+,-$. 
The  metric $g_{MN}$ and extra gamma-matrices are
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
The gamma-matrices satisfy the following algebra:
\beq

where the set $\bar\Gamma^{M}$ differs from $\Gamma^{M}$  by interchanging of
the $+,-$ components, $\bar\Gamma^{\pm}=\Gamma^{\mp}$.
The gauge covariant derivatives ${\cal D}^M$ are defined as
\beqn

and similarly for ${\cal D}^{M}\psi$, while the general covariant derivatives $D^{M}\psi$ are
\begin{equation}
D^{M}\psi^{i}=

\subsection{Gauged formulation, switching on the heterotic deformation}
\label{gfsothd}


The general formulation of \ntwoo gauge theories in two dimensions was addressed by Witten in 
\cite{W93}, see also \cite{Witten:2005px}.
In order to deform the \cpn model breaking \ntt down to \mbox{\nzt}
we must introduce a right-handed spinor field $\zeta_R$ whose  target space is $C$ 
(with a bosonic superpartner \cf), which is coupled to other fields as follows
\cite{EdTo,SY1}:
\beqn
\Delta\cell 
&=&
\bar\zeta_R\, i\pt_L\, \zeta_R   +\bar\cfe\,\cfe
	\nonumber\\[2mm]
&-&
 2i\, \omega \, \bar\lambda_L\, \zeta_R -  2i\, \bar{\omega} \, \bar\zeta_R\, \lambda_L +
	 2i\, \omega \, \cfe\, \sigma +
 2i\, \bar{\omega} \, \bar\cfe\, \bar{\sigma}\,,
 \label{deforte}
\eeqn
where we define
\beq
\omega = \sqrt{2\beta}\,\delta\,.
\label{deffp}
\eeq
This term must be added to the \ntt Lagrangian (\ref{bee31}). 
It is quite obvious that the dependence on (\ref{combi}) is gone. 
The deformation term (\ref{deforte}) has a separate dependence on $\sigma$, not reducible to the
combination (\ref{combi}). Therefore, for a generic choice, all $N$ twisted mass
parameters $m_1,\,m_2,\, ..., m_N$ become observable, Eq. (\ref{one}) is no longer valid.

\vspace{1mm}

Eliminating \cf, $\bar\cfe$  and $\bar\lambda ,\,\lambda$ we get
\beq
\Delta\cell = 4\, |\omega |^2\,|\sigma |^2\,,
\label{deffpp}
\eeq
while the constraints (\ref{npxi}) are replaced by
\beqn
\bar{n}_i\,\xi^i_L
&= &
0\,,\qquad \bar\xi_{Ri}\,n^i = 0\,,
\nonumber\\[2mm]
\bar{n}_i\,\xi^i_R
&= &
 -\sqrt{2}\,\omega\zeta_R\,,\qquad \bar\xi_{Ri}\,n^i =  -\sqrt{2}\,\bar\omega\bar\zeta_R\,.
\label{npxip}
\eeqn

We still have to discuss how the parameter $\omega$ is related to other
deformation parameters (which are equivalent to $\omega$), and their $N$ dependence.
We want to single out appropriate powers of $N$ so that the large-$N$ limit will be smooth.
The parameter $\delta$ in Eq.~(\ref{deforte}) is $N$-independent. Therefore, $\omega$ scales as
$\sqrt N$.

One can restore the original form of 
the constraints (\ref{npxi})  by   shifting  the $ \xir $ fields, namely,
\beq
\xi_R'= \xir + \sqrt{2}\, \bar{\delta}\, n\, \bar\zeta_R\,, \qquad
\bar\xi_R'= \bar\xi_R + \sqrt{2}\, {\delta}\, \bar{n}\, \zeta_R\,.
\label{wtpi7}
\eeq
This obviously changes the normalization of the kinetic term for $ \zr $, which we can
bring back to its canonic form by a rescaling $ \zr $,
\beq
	\zr  \to   ( 1 - |\gamma|^2 )\, \zr\,.
	\label{wtpi8}
\eeq
As a result of these transformations,  the following Lagrangian emerges:
\beqn
\cell 
&=&
 \bzr\, i\pt_L\, \zr
-\omega\, i\pt_L\nbar \xir\, \zr - \bar{\omega}\, \bxir i\p_L n\, \bzr
+ |\tilde\gamma|^2\, \bxil \xil\, \bzr \zr
	\nonumber\\[3mm]
	&-&
 i\omega\, m^l\, \bar{n}_l \, \xi_L^l\, \zr 
	+ i\omega\, \bar{m}^l\, \bar{\xi}_{Ll} n^l\, \bzr
\nonumber\\[3mm]
&+&
2\beta \left\{\rule{0mm}{6mm}
		| \pt_k n |^2  +\! (\nbar  \p_k n)^2 + \! \bxir i\p_L \xir +\! \bxil  i\p_R \xil
	-\!  (\nbar  i\p_R n)  \bxil \xil - \! (\nbar  i\p_L n) \bxir \xir
	\right.
\nonumber\\[3mm]
&+& (1-|\tilde\gamma|^2)\,\bxil\xir\,\bxir\xil - \bxir\xir\,\bxil\xil
	\nonumber\\[5mm]
&+&
  \sum_l |m^l|^2 \left|n^l \right|^2 
- i m^l\, \bar{\xi}_{Rl} \xi_L^l ~-~ i\bar{m}^l\, \bar{\xi}_{Ll} \xi_R^l
\nonumber\\[3mm]
&-&
\left.
 (1-|\tilde\gamma|^2)
	\left(
	 \left|\sum m^l |n^l|^2 \right|^2 
		- i m^l\, |n^l|^2 (\bxir\xil) - i\bar{m}^l\, |n^l|^2(\bxil\xir)
	\right) \right\}.
	\label{sigma_phys}
\eeqn
The sums over $l$ above run from $l=1$ to $N$. If the masses are chosen \zn-symmetrically, see
(\ref{two}), this Lagrangian is explicitly \zn-symmetric, see  Appendix~B.

If all $m_l=0$,  the model (\ref{sigma_phys}) reduces to the \nzt \cpn model
derived in \cite{SY1}, see (\ref{bee31}). 
Later on we will examine
other special choices for the  the mass terms. Here we will only note that
with all $m_l \neq 0$ the masses of the boson and fermion excitations following from
(\ref{sigma_phys}) split. Say, in the $l_0$-th vacuum
\beqn
M_{\rm ferm}^{(l)} 
&=&
 m^l - m^{l_0} + |\tilde\gamma|^2\,m^{l_0} \,,
	\nonumber\\[2mm]
	\left| M_{\rm bos}^{(l)} \right|
	&=&
	\sqrt{ \left| M^{(l)}_{\rm ferm} \right|^2 - |\tilde\gamma|^4\, \left| m^{l_0}\right|^2}
	\,,
	\nonumber\\[3mm]
	l
	&=&
	 1,2, ..., N;\quad l\neq l_0\,.
\eeqn


	The model (\ref{sigma_phys}) still contains redundant fields.
	In particular, there are $N$ bosonic fields $n^l$ and $N$ fermionic $\xi^l$,
	whereas the number of physical degrees of 
	freedom is $2\times(N-1)$. 
	One can readily eliminate the redundant fields, say, $n^N$ and $\xi^N$,
	by exploiting the constraints (\ref{npxi}). Then explicit \zn-symmetry will be lost, of course.
	It will survive as an implicit symmetry.

\subsection{Geometric formulation, \boldmath{$\tilde\gamma \neq 0$}} 
\label{gftgnz}

The parameter of the heterotic deformation in the geometric formulation will be denoted by
$\tilde \gamma$ (the tilde appears here for historical reasons;
perhaps, in the future it will be reasonable to omit it).

To obtain the Lagrangian of the heterotically deformed model
we act as follows \cite{BSY3}: we start from (\ref{eq:kinetic}), add the
 right-handed spinor field $\zeta_R$, with the same kinetic term as in Sect.~\ref{gfsothd}, and
 add the bifermion terms
 \beq
 \frac{\tilde\gamma \,g_0}{\sqrt 2}
 \left[\zeta_RG_{i\bar j}\left(i\pt_L\bar\phi^{\,\bar j}
 \right)\psi_R^i + \bar\zeta_R G_{i\bar j}\left(i\pt_L\phi^{i}
 \right)\bar\psi_R^{\,\bar j} 
 \right].
 \eeq
Next, we change the four-fermion terms exactly in the same way this was done in
 \cite{SY1},
 namely
 \beqn
&-&\frac{1}{2} \,R_{i\bar jk\bar l}\left[\left(\bar\psi^{\bar j}\psi^{i}\right)\left(\bar\psi^{\bar l}\psi^{k}\right)
\left(\bar\psi^{\bar j}\psi^{i}\right)\left(\bar\psi^{\bar l}\psi^{k}\right)
\right]
\nonumber\\[3mm]
&\to&
- \frac{g_0^2}{2}\left( G_{i\bar j}\psi^{\dagger\, \bar j}_R\, \psi^{ i}_R\right)
\left( G_{k\bar m}\psi^{\dagger\, \bar m}_L\, \psi^{ k}_L\right)+
\frac{g_0^2}{2}\left(1-|\tilde\gamma|^2\right)
\left( G_{i\bar j}\psi^{\dagger\, \bar j}_R\, \psi^{ i}_L\right)
\left( G_{k\bar m}\psi^{\dagger\, \bar m}_L\, \psi^{ k}_R\right)\,,
\nonumber
\\[4mm]
&-&
 \frac{g_0^2}{2} \, |\tilde{\gamma} |^2 \,\left(\zeta_R^\dagger\, \zeta_R
\right)\left(G_{i\bar j}\,  \psi_L^{\dagger\,\bar j}\psi_L^i\right),
\eeqn
 where the first line represents the last term in Eq.~(\ref{eq:kinetic}), and we used the identity~(\ref{640}).
 If one of the twisted masses from the set  $\{m_1,\,m_2,\, ..., m_N\}$ vanishes (say, $m^N=0$),
then this is the end of the story. The masses 
$m_a$ in Eqs. (\ref{wtpi1}) and (\ref{wtpi2}) are $\{m_1,\,m_2,\, ..., m_{N-1}\}$.

However, with more general twisted mass sets,
for instance, for the \zn-symmetric masses (\ref{two}), 
one arrives at a more contrived situation since 
one should take into account an extra contribution.
Occurrence of this contribution can be seen \cite{BSY3} in a relatively concise
manner using the superfield formalism of \cite{SY1},
\beq
\Delta\cell \sim M\int  {\mathcal B}\,\,  d\bar\theta_L \, d\theta_R + {\rm H. c.}\,,
\label{tftpi1}
\eeq
where
${\mathcal B}$ is a (dimensionless) \nzt superfield\,\footnote{This means that ${\mathcal B}$
is the superfield only with respect to the right-handed transformations.}
\beq
{\mathcal B} =\left\{\zeta_R\left(x^\mu + i\bar\theta\gamma^\mu\theta\right) +\sqrt{2} \theta_R {\mathcal F}
\right\} \bar\theta_L\,.
\label{tftpi2}
\eeq
 The parameter $M$ appearing in (\ref{tftpi1}) has dimension of mass; in fact, it is proportional to $m^N$.
 
 As a result, the heterotically deformed \cpn Lagrangian with all $N$ twisted mass parameters included
can be written in the following general form:
 \beq
 \cell = \cell_\zeta + \cell_{m=0} +\cell_m\,,
 \label{tftpi3}
 \eeq
 where the notation is self-explanatory. The expression for $\cell_m$ is quite combersome.
 We will not reproduce it here, referring the interested reader to \cite{BSY3}.
 For convenience, we present here the first two terms,
\beqn
\cell_\zeta + \cell_{m=0} && 
= 
\zeta_R^\dagger \, i\partial_L \, \zeta_R  + 
\left[\tilde\gamma\, \frac{g_0}{\sqrt 2} \, \zeta_R  \, G_{i\bar j}\,  \big( i\,\partial_{L}\phi^{\dagger\,\bar j} \big)\psi_R^i
+{\rm H.c.}\right]
\nonumber
\\[4mm]
&&
 -\frac{g_0^2}{2}\, |\tilde\gamma |^2 \,\left(\zeta_R^\dagger\, \zeta_R
\right)\left(G_{i\bar j}\,  \psi_L^{\dagger\,\bar j}\psi_L^i\right)
\nonumber
\\[4mm]
&&
+G_{i\bar j} \big[\partial_\mu \phi^{\dagger\,\bar j}\, \partial_\mu\phi^{i}
+i\bar \psi^{\bar j} \gamma^{\mu} D_{\mu}\psi^{i}\big]
\nonumber
\\[4mm]
&&
- \frac{g_0^2}{2}\left( G_{i\bar j}\psi^{\dagger\, \bar j}_R\, \psi^{ i}_R\right)
\left( G_{k\bar m}\psi^{\dagger\, \bar m}_L\, \psi^{ k}_L\right)
\nonumber
\\[4mm]
&&
+\frac{g_0^2}{2}\left(1-|\tilde\gamma|^2\right)
\left( G_{i\bar j}\psi^{\dagger\, \bar j}_R\, \psi^{ i}_L\right)
\left( G_{k\bar m}\psi^{\dagger\, \bar m}_L\, \psi^{ k}_R\right)\,,
\label{cpn-1g}
\eeqn
where we used (\ref{640}). The above Lagrangian is \nzt-supersymmetric at the classical level.
Supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by nonperturbative effects \cite{EdTo,SYhet}. 
Inclusion of $\cell_m$ spontanesously breaks supersymmetry at the classical level \cite{BSY3}, see
Eq.~(\ref{}).

The relation between $\tilde\gamma$ and $\delta$
is as follows \cite{BSY3}:
\beq
-i\,\tilde\gamma_M=\tilde\gamma_E = \sqrt{2} \frac{\delta_E}{\sqrt{1+ 2 |\delta |^2}},
\label{tftpi4}
\eeq
implying that $\tilde \gamma$ does {\em not} scale with $N$ in the 't Hooft limit.




\section{Large-\boldmath{$N$} solution
of the \cpn model with twisted masses}
\setcounter{equation}{0}






In this section we present a large $N$ solution of \ntwot supersymmetric $CP(N-1)$ model 
with twisted masses (\ref{bee31}). We consider a special case of mass deformation
(\ref{two}) 
preserving a $Z_N$
symmetry of the model. 
The \ntwot  model with zero twisted masses as well as nonsupersymmetric $CP(N-1)$ model
were solved by Witten in the large-$N$ limit \cite{W79}.
The same method was used in
\cite{GSYphtr} to study nonsupersymmetric $CP(N-1)$ model with twisted mass. In this section we will generalize Witten's analysis 
to solve the \ntwot theory with twisted masses. 

First let us briefly review the physics of non-supersymmetric \cpn model reveled
by large $N$ solution in \cite{GSYphtr}.
In the limit of vanishing mass deformation, the
$CP(N-1)$ model is known to be a strongly coupled asymptotically free
field theory
\cite{P75}. A dynamical scale $\Lambda$ is generated as a result of
dimensional transmutation.
However, at large $N$ it can be solved by virtue of $1/N$ expansion
\cite{W79}.
The solution found by Witten exhibits a composite photon,
coupled to $N$ quanta $n$, each with charge $1/\sqrt N$ with respect
to this photon. In two dimensions the corresponding potential is long-range.
It causes linear confinement, so that only $n^*n$ pairs show up in the
spectrum \cite{Coleman,W79}. This is the reason why we refer to this phase as
``Coulomb/confining." In the Coulomb/confining phase the vacuum 
is unique and the $Z_N$ symmetry is unbroken.

On the other hand, if the mass deformation parameter is $m\gg
\Lambda$,
the model is at weak coupling, the field $n$ develops a vacuum
expectation value (VEV),
there are $N$ physically equivalent vacua, in each of which the
$Z_N$ symmetry is spontaneously broken. We  refer to this regime
as the
Higgs phase.

In Ref. \cite{GSY05}
it was argued that non-supersymmetric twisted mass deformed $CP(N-1)$ model
undergoes a phase transition when the value of the mass parameter is
$\sim \Lambda$ to the Higgs phase with broken $Z_N$ symmetry.
 In \cite{GSYphtr} this result was confirmed by large $N$ solution.
The issue of two phases and phase transitions in related models
was also addressed by Ferrari
\cite{Ferrari,Ferrari2}.

In \ntwot supersymmetric \cpn model we do not expect a phase transition with respect to 
twisted mass to occur. Below in this section we confirm this expectation showing
that $Z_N$ symmetry is  broken at all values of twisted mass. Still the theory has two 
different regimes, the Higgs regime at large $m$ and the  strong-coupling one at small $m$.



Since the action (\ref{bee31}) is quadratic in the fields $n^{i}$ and $\xi^i$
we can integrate over these fields and then minimize the resulting
effective action with respect to the  fields from the gauge multiplet. The large-$N$ limit ensures the corrections to the saddle point approximation to be  small. In fact,
this procedure boils down to calculating a small set of one-loop graphs with the
$n^{i}$ and $\xi^i$  fields propagating in loops.

In the Higgs regime the field $n^{i_0}$ develop a VEV.
One can always choose $i_0=0$ and denote $n^{i_0}\equiv n$. 
The field $n$, along with $\sigma$, are
our order parameters that distinguish between the
strong coupling  and the Higgs regimes. These parameters show rather dramatic crossover behavior
when we move from one regime to another.

Therefore, we do not want
to integrate over $n$ {\em a priory}. Instead,
we will stick to the following strategy:  we integrate over $N-1$
fields $n^{i}$ with $i \ne 0$.
The resulting effective action is to be considered as
a functional of $n$, $D$ and
$\sigma$. To find the vacuum configuration, we will minimize the
effective action with
respect to $n$, $D$ and
$\sigma$.


Integration over $n^{i}$ and $\xi^i$ in (\ref{bee31})
yields the following determinants:
\beq
 \frac{
\prod_{i=1}^{N-1} {\rm det}\, \left(-\pt_{k}^2 
+|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2\right)}{
\prod_{i=1}^{N-1}{\rm det}\, \left(-\pt_{k}^2 +iD
+|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2\right)},
\label{det}
\eeq
where we dropped the gauge field $A_k$. The  determinant in the denominator here comes from the
boson loops while the one in the numerator from fermion loops. Note, that the $n^{i}$ mass 
 is given by $iD+|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2$ while that of fermions $\xi^i$
is $2|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2$. If supersymmetry is unbroken (i.e.  $D=0$) these masses are equal,
and the product of the determinants reduces to unity, as
it should be.

Calculation of the determinants in Eq.~(\ref{det}) 
is straightforward. We easily get the following contribution to the
effective action:
\beqn
&&\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\frac{1}{4\pi}\left\{\left(iD
+|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2\right)
\left[\ln\, {\frac{M_{\rm uv}^2}{iD
+|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2}}+1\right]
\right.
\nonumber\\
&-&
\left. 
|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2
\left[\ln\, {\frac{M_{\rm uv}^2}{
|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2}}+1\right]
\right\},
\label{detr}
\eeqn
where quadratically divergent contributions from bosons and fermions do
not depend on
$D$ and $\sigma$ and cancel each other. Here $M_{\rm uv}$ is an ultraviolet (UV) cutoff.
 The bare coupling constant
 $2\beta_0$ in (\ref{bee31}) can be parametrized as
\beq
2\beta_0=\frac{N}{4\pi}\, \ln\, {\frac{M_{\rm uv}^2}{\Lambda^2}}\,.
\eeq
Substituting this expression in (\ref{bee31}) and adding 
the one-loop correction
(\ref{detr})
we see that the term proportional to 
$iD \ln\, {M_{\rm uv}^2}$ is canceled out, and the effective action is
expressed in terms of the renormalized coupling constant,
\beq
\rule{0mm}{8mm}
2\beta_{\rm ren}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\, 
\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\ln\, {\frac{iD +|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2}{\Lambda^2}}\, .
\label{coupling}
\eeq

\vspace{2mm}

Assembling  all contributions together and dropping gauginos $\lambda$ we get the effective potential as 
a function of $n$, $D$ and $\sigma$ fields  in
the form
\beqn
	V_\text{eff} & =& \int d^2x 
		\left\{  \left( iD ~+~ 2\,\Bigl|\sigma - \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr|^2 \right) |n|^2 \right.
	\nonumber\\[4mm]
	&-& 
	\frac{1}{4\pi}\, \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \Bigl( iD ~+~ 2\,\Bigl|\sigma - \frac{m_i}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr|^2 \Bigr)\,
		\ln\, \frac{ iD \,+\, 2 | \sigma - \frac{\displaystyle m_i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} |^2} {\Lambda^2}
\nonumber\\[4mm]
	&+& 
	\frac{1}{4\pi}\, \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} 2\,\Bigl|\sigma - \frac{m_i}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr|^2\,
			\ln\, \frac{ 2\, | \sigma - \frac{\displaystyle m_i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} |^2 }
 { \Lambda^2 }
	+
	\frac{1}{4\pi}\, iD\, (N-1)  \Biggr .
	\nonumber\\
	\label{Veff22}
\eeqn
Now, to find the vacua, we must minimize the 
effective potential (\ref{Veff22}) with respect to $n$, $D$ and $ \sigma $. In this way we  arrive at
the set of	the vacuum equations,
\beqn
\label{22eff1}
	&&
	|n|^2  = 2\beta_{\rm ren}\,, 
\\[3mm]				
	&&
	\left( i D ~~+~~ 2\,\Bigl|\sigma - \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr|^2 \right) n = 0\,, 
	\label{22eff2}
	\\[3mm]
	&&
	\Bigl(\sigma - \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr)|n|^2 
		-
	\frac{1}{4\pi} \sum_i^{N-1}\,
			\Bigl(\sigma - \frac{m^i}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr)\,
		{\rm ln}\, 
		\frac{i D + 2\, \Bigl| \sigma \,-\, \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} \Bigr|^2}
		{2\, \Bigl| \sigma - \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} \Bigr|^2}
		 ~~=~~ 0\,,
\label{22eff3}
\nonumber\\
\eeqn
where $2\beta_{\rm ren}$ is determined by Eq.~(\ref{coupling}).

From Eq.~(\ref{22eff2}) it is obvious that there are two options, either
\beq
\label{higgsph22}
	 iD + 2\,\left| \sigma - \frac{ m_0}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = 0  
\eeq
or
\beq
\label{strongph22}
	 n = 0 \,. 
\eeq
	These two distinct solutions correspond to the Higgs and the strong-coupling regimes of the theory. 
	


Equations (\ref{22eff1})-(\ref{22eff3}) represent our {\em master set} which
determines the vacua of the theory. 

\begin{center}
{\bf Higgs regime}
\end{center}



Consider first the Higgs regime.
For large $m$ we have
\beq
D=0,\qquad \sqrt{2}\sigma=m_0,\qquad |n|^2=2\beta_{\rm ren}.
\label{higgsvac}
\eeq
The first condition here, $D=0$ means that the \ntwot supersymmetry is not broken and the vacuum
energy is zero. Integrating over $n$'s and $\xi$'s we fixed $n^{0}\equiv n$. Clearly we can fix
any other $n^{i_0}$. Then (\ref{higgsvac}) takes the form 
\beq
D=0,\qquad \sqrt{2}\sigma=m_{i_0},\qquad |n^{i_0}|^2=2\beta_{\rm ren}
\label{higgsvacN}
\eeq
showing presence of $N$ degenerate vacua. The discrete chiral $Z_{2N}$ symmetry (\ref{bee35})
is broken by these VEV's down to $Z_2$. Substituting expressions for $D$ and $\sigma$ in (\ref{coupling})
we get for the renormalized coupling 
\beq
2\beta_{\rm ren}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\, 
\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\ln\, {\frac{|m_{i_0}-m_i|^2}{\Lambda^2}}=\frac{N}{2\pi}\,\ln\,{\frac{m}{\Lambda}}\, ,
\label{22higgscoupling}
\eeq
where we have calculated the sum over $i$ in the large $N$ limit for the special choice of masses
 in (\ref{two}).

There are $2(N-1)$ elementary excitations\,\footnote{Here we count
real degrees of
freedom. The action (\ref{bee31}) contains $N$ complex fields
$n^i$.
The phase of $n^{i_0}$ can be eliminated from the very beginning.
The condition $|n^i|^2 = 2\beta$ eliminates one more field.
} with physical masses
\beq
M_i = |m_i-m_{i_0}|\,,\qquad i\neq i_0\,.
\label{elmass}
\eeq
Besides, there are kinks (domain ``walls" which are particles in two
dimensions) interpolating between these vacua. Their masses scale as
\beq
M^{\rm kink}_{i} \sim \beta_{\rm ren}\,M_i \,.
\label{kinkmass}
\eeq
The kinks  are much  heavier than elementary
excitations at weak coupling. Note that they have nothing to do
with Witten's $n$ solitons \cite{W79} identified as solitons at
strong coupling.

Since $|n^{i_0}|^2=2\beta_{\rm ren}$ is positively defined we see that the crossover point is
at $m=\Lambda$. Below this point VEV of $n$ is zero and we are in the strong coupling regime.

\begin{center}
{\bf Strong coupling regime}
\end{center}

For small $m$ 
solutions of equations (\ref{22eff1})-(\ref{22eff3}) can be readily found,
\beq
D=0,\qquad n=0,\qquad
2\beta_{\rm ren}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\, 
\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\ln\, {\frac{|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2}{\Lambda^2}}=0.
\label{strongvac}
\eeq
Much in the same way as in the Higgs regime, the condition $D=0$ means that the \ntwot
 supersymmetry is not broken.

The last equation can be rewritten as 
\beq
\prod_{i=0}^{N-1}\,|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i| \,=\,\Lambda^N
\label{Witcond}
\eeq
Note, that although we derived this equation in the large $N$ approximation it is, in fact,
exact. I follows from the  exact superpotential for \ntwot \cpn model \cite{AdDVecSal,ChVa,W93,HaHo,Dor}.

For the special choice of masses
 in (\ref{two}) equation (\ref{Witcond}) can be solved. Assuming for simplicity that $N=2^p$
we rewrite this equation in the form
\beq
|(\sqrt{2}\sigma)^N-m^N|=\Lambda^N,
\eeq
which has $N$ solutions
\beq
\sqrt{2}\sigma =\left(\Lambda^N+m^N\right)^{1/N}\,
\exp\left( \frac{2\pi\,i\, k}{N}
\right), \quad k=0, ..., N-1,
\label{22sigma}
\eeq
where we assumed for simplicity that $m\equiv m_0$ is real and positive.
This solution shows the presence of $N$ degenerate vacua. Since $\sigma$ is nonzero in all these vacua
the discrete chiral $Z_{2N}$ symmetry is broken down to $Z_2$ in the strong coupling regime much in the   same way as
in the Higgs regime. This should be contrasted with large $N$ solution of the non-supersymmetric
massive \cpn model \cite{GSYphtr}. In the latter model $\sigma=0$ in the strong coupling phase, so the theory
has only one single vacuum state and $Z_{2N}$ symmetry is restored. This is a signal of a phase transition
separating Higgs and Coulomb/confining phase in the non-supersymmetric massive \cpn model \cite{GSYphtr}.

In fact, in the large $N$ approximation result in ({\ref{22sigma}) can be rewritten as
\beq
\sqrt{2}\sigma =\exp\left( \frac{2\pi\,i\, k}{N}
\right)\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\Lambda\;\;\;\;\;\;m <\Lambda\\
\;\;m\;\;\;\;\;\; m > \Lambda
\end{array},
\right.
 \quad k=0, ..., N-1
\label{22sigmaapp}
\eeq
with the exponential accuracy with respect to $N$. Note that at large $m$ this formula reproduces our
result (\ref{higgsvacN}) obtained in the Higgs regime. In the limit $m\to 0$ it gives Witten's
result obtained in \cite{W79}

\begin{figure}
\epsfxsize=7cm
\centerline{\epsfbox{nsigma22.eps}}
\caption{\small Plots of $n$ and $\sigma$ VEV's (thick lines) vs. $m$. }
\label{fig22nsigma}
\end{figure}

The behavior of VEV's $n$ and $\sigma$ as functions of $m$ are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig22nsigma}.
These plots suggest that we have  discontinuities in derivatives with respect to $m$ for both order
parameters. This would signal phase transition, of course. We note, however, that exact formula
(\ref{22sigma}) shows a smooth behavior of $\sigma$. Therefore we interpret the discontinuity in
(\ref{22sigmaapp}) as an artifact of large $N$ approximation. The crossover transition between two
regimes become more and more pronounced as we increase $N$ and turn into a phase transition in the
limit $N\to\infty$. We stress again that $Z_{2N}$ symmetry is broken down to $Z_2$ in both regimes.

There is one interesting special regime in Eq.~(\ref{Witcond}). If \footnote{Strictly speaking 
the phase does not follow from (\ref{Witcond}). It is written down below using  the complex version of Eq.~(\ref{Witcond}), which follows from the exact superpotential for \ntwot \cpn model
\cite{AdDVecSal,ChVa,W93,HaHo,Dor}.}
\beq
\prod_{i=0}^{N-1}\,(-m_i) \,=\,\Lambda^N
\label{ADpoint}
\eeq
all $N$ vacua coalesce at  
\beq
\sigma=0.
\label{ADsigma}
\eeq
At this point in the mass parameter space one of $N$ kinks interpolating between two
"neighboring" vacua becomes massless. This point determines a non-trivial conformal regime in the
theory. This is a two dimensional image of the four dimensional
Argyres-Douglas point \cite{AD,APSW}.



\section{Heterotic \cpn model at small deformations}
\setcounter{equation}{0}



To build construct an effective action allowing us to explore the vacuum structure of the
model under consideration, we integrate over all but one given $ n^l $ filed (and its superpartner $ \xi^l $).
One can alway choose this fixed (unintegrated) field to be the last one, $n^N$.
To the leading order in $1/N$ we can (and will) ignore the gauge field $ A_\mu $.
The fields $ n^i $ and $ \xi^i $  ($ i = 1,...\, N-1 $) enter the Lagrangian quadratically,
\beqn
\cell &=&
 \nbar{}_i 
		   \left( - \p_k^2 ~+~ 2\,\Bigl| \sigma - \frac{m^i}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigr|^2 +  i\, D \right) n^i
		   + ...
\nonumber\\[4mm]
&+&
\left( \bxi_{Ri}\,\,  \bxi_{Li} \right)
		\left( \begin{matrix}
			i\,\pt_L  &  
			i\,\sqrt{2}\, \Bigl(\sigma - \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}}\Bigr) \\
			i\,\sqrt{2}\,\Bigl(\ov{\sigma} - \frac{\displaystyle \ov{m}{}^i}{\displaystyle\sqrt{2}}\Bigr) &  
			i\,\p_R 
		     \end{matrix} \right)
		\left( \begin{matrix}
			\xi_R^i \\[5mm] \xi_L^i
		     \end{matrix} \right)+ ... ,
\eeqn
where the ellipses denote terms which contain neither $n$ nor $\xi$ fields.
Integrating over the $n$, $\xi$ fields produces the determinant
\beq
	\prod_{i=1}^{N-1}\,\, \,
	\frac{ \det \left( -\pt_k^2 + 
			2\,\Bigl| \sigma - \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} \Bigr|^2 \right) }
             { \det \left( -\p_k^2 + 
			2\,\Bigl| \sigma - \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} \Bigr|^2 + i\, D \right)} \,.
\label{determ}
\eeq
Assuming $\sigma$ and $D$ to be constant background fields,
introducing the notation
\beq
n^N \equiv n \,,\qquad m^N  \equiv  m_0\,,
\label{nnotat}
\eeq
and  evaluating this determinant, 
one arrives at the following effective potential:
\beqn
	V_\text{eff} & =& \int d^2x 
		\left\{  \left( iD ~+~ 2\,\Bigl|\sigma - \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr|^2 \right) |n|^2 \right.
	\nonumber\\[4mm]
	&-& 
	\frac{1}{4\pi}\, \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \Bigl( iD ~+~ 2\,\Bigl|\sigma - \frac{m^i}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr|^2 \Bigr)\,
		\ln\, \frac{ iD \,+\, 2 | \sigma - \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} |^2} {\Lambda^2}
\nonumber\\[4mm]
	&+&
	\frac{1}{4\pi}\, \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} 2\,\Bigl|\sigma - \frac{m^i}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr|^2\,
			\ln\, \frac{ 2\, | \sigma - \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} |^2 } { \Lambda^2 }
	+
	\frac{1}{4\pi}\, iD\, (N-1) 
+
	4\, |\omega|^2\,\bigl|\sigma\bigr|^2 \Biggr .
	\nonumber\\
	\label{Veff}
\eeqn
Now, to find the vacua, we must minimize the 
effective potential (\ref{Veff}) with respect to $n$, $D$ and $ \sigma $. In this way we one arrive at
the set of	the vacuum equations,
\beqn
\label{eff1}
	&&
	|n|^2  -  \frac{1}{4\pi} \,\sum_i^{N-1}\, 
		{\rm ln}\, 
		\frac{i D + 2\, \Bigl| \sigma -  \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} \Bigr|^2}
							{\Lambda^2}   = 0\,, 
\\[3mm]				
	&&
	\left( i D ~~+~~ 2\,\Bigl|\sigma - \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr|^2 \right) n = 0\,, 
	\label{eff2}
	\\[3mm]
	&&
	\Bigl(\sigma - \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr)|n|^2 
		-
	\frac{1}{4\pi} \sum_i^{N-1}\,
			\Bigl(\sigma - \frac{m^i}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigr)\,
		{\rm ln}\, 
		\frac{i D + 2\, \Bigl| \sigma \,-\, \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} \Bigr|^2}
		{2\, \Bigl| \sigma - \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} \Bigr|^2}
		+ 2\, |\omega|^2\sigma ~~=~~ 0\,.
\label{eff3}
\nonumber\\
\eeqn
From Eq.~(\ref{eff2}) it is obvious that there are two options, either
\beq
\label{higgsph}
	 iD + 2\,\left| \sigma - \frac{ m_0}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = 0  
\eeq
or
\beq
\label{strongph}
	 n = 0 \,. 
\eeq
	These two distinct solutions correspond to the Higgs and the strong-coupling regimes of the theory. 
	
As a first step, we solve these equations perturbatively, assuming $ |\omega|^2 $ to be a small parameter,
\beqn
	n &=& \nz  + |\omega|^2\,\no + \ldots\,,
	\nonumber
	 \\[3mm]
	iD &=& i\Dz  + |\omega|^2\,i\Do + \ldots\,, 
	\nonumber
	\\[3mm]
	\sigma &=& \sigz + |\omega|^2\,\sigo + \ldots\,.
\eeqn
	Here $ \nz $, $ \Dz $ and $\sigz$ constitute the solution of the \ntwot CP($N-1$) sigma model,
	in particular $ \Dz = 0 $ in both phases.

	To obtain simple expressions for the solution we will assume the masses to be sitting
	on the circle,
\[
	m^k ~~=~~ m \cdot e^{i 2\pi k / N }\,, \qquad\qquad k ~=~ 0,...\, N-1\,.
\]

\subsection{The Higgs regime}

	The large-$N$ supersymmetric solution of the \ntwot CP($N-1$) sigma model
	in the Higgs phase is
\begin{align*}
%
	\nz & ~~=~~ \sqrt{\rrenz}\,,   \qquad\qquad\qquad\text{\it the phase of $\nz$ is not determined}\\[3mm]
%
	i\Dz & ~~=~~ ~~~\,0\,, \\[2mm]
%
	\sigz & ~~=~~ ~~\frac{m_0}{\sqrt{2}}\,,
\end{align*}
	where $ \rrenz $ is the renormalized coupling of the unperturbed theory,
\[
	\rrenz ~~=~~ \frac{N}{2\pi}\,{\rm log}\,m/\Lambda\,.
\]

Expanding Eqs. (\ref{eff1}) -- (\ref{eff3}) to the first order in $|\omega|^2$, we obtain
\begin{align}
%
\notag
	&
	\bnz\,\no ~+~ \text{h.c.} ~~=~~
	\frac{1}{4\pi}\, \sum_{i}^{N-1}\, 
		\frac{ i\Do ~+~ 2\lgr \bsigz\, \sigo ~-~ \bsigo\,\frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}}
				~+~ \text{h.c.} \rgr }
			{ 2 \Bigl| \sigz - \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\sqrt{\displaystyle 2}} \Bigr|^2 }\,, \\
%
\label{higgseq}
	&
	i\Do ~~=~~ 0\,, \\[2mm]
%
\notag
	&
	\sigo\,|\nz|^2  ~-~ 
	\frac{1}{4\pi}\,i\Do\, \sum_{i}^{N-1}\, \frac{1}
				{2\Bigl( \bsigz - \frac{\displaystyle \ov{m}{}^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} \Bigr) }
	~+~ 2\,\sigz ~~=~~ 0\,.
\end{align}
	We can see that $ iD $ vanishes to the first order in $ |\omega|^2 $.
	Thus, for $ iD $ the first order of expansion is not sufficient, since we know that supersymmetry
	is broken and hence $ iD ~\neq~ 0 $.
	This variable, however, is easy to recover in the Higgs phase given the corresponding expansion of $ \sigma $
	via Eq.~(\ref{higgsph}).

	The solution of Eqs.~(\ref{higgseq}) can be written as
\begin{align*}
%
	i \Dz & ~~=~~ 0\,,                     &       i\Do & ~~=~~ 0\,,  
			\qquad\qquad iD^{(2)} ~~=~~ -\,2\,|\sigo|^2\,, \\[3mm]
%
	\sigz & ~~=~~ \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{2}}\,,  &       \sigo & ~~=~~ -\,\frac{2\sigz}{|\nz|^2}\,, \\[3mm]
%
	|\nz|^2 & ~~=~~ \rrenz\,,              &    
			\no & ~~=~~ -\,\frac{2\,m^0}{\bnz\,|\nz|^2}\,\frac{1}{4\pi}\,
					\sum_{i}^{N-1} \frac{1}{m^0 - m^i}\,.
\end{align*}	

	To simplify these expressions, as noted before, we put the masses on the circle, which gives then
\[
	\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \frac{1}{m^0 - m^i} ~~=~~ \frac{N-1}{2m} ~~=~~ \frac{N}{2m} ~~+~~ O(1)\,.
\]
	Finally, we obtain 
\begin{align*}
%
	\sigma & ~~=~~ \frac{m^0}{\sqrt{2}}\, \lgr 1 ~~-~~ \frac{2\,|\omega|^2}{|\nz|^2} \rgr ~~+~~ \ldots \,,
	\\[2mm]
%
	i D & ~~=~~ -\, 4\, \frac{m_0^2}{(\rrenz)^2}\, |\omega|^4 ~~+~~ \ldots\,,
	\\[2mm]
%
	n & ~~=~~ \sqrt{\rrenz} ~~-~~ \frac{N}{4\pi}\,\frac{1}{\rrenz\,\bnz}\,|\omega|^2 ~~+~~ \ldots
\end{align*}
	for the Higgs phase, where
\[
	\rrenz ~~=~~ \frac{N}{2\pi}\,{\rm log}\,m/\Lambda\,.
\]

\subsection{Strong coupling}

	The zeroth order in $ |\omega|^2 $ solution is 
\begin{align*}
%
	\nz & ~~=~~ 0\,, \\[2mm]
%
	i \Dz & ~~=~~ 0\,, \\[2mm]
%
	\sigz & ~~=~~ \wt{\Lambda}\cdot e^{i\frac{2\pi l}{N}}\,,  
	\qquad\qquad\qquad
	\wt{\Lambda} ~~=~~ \sqrt[N]{ \Lambda^N ~+~ m^N }\,,
\end{align*}
	for some fixed $ l = 0,...\,N-1 $.
	Furthermore, in this phase  $ n $ is known exactly,
\[
	n ~~=~~ 0\,.
\]
	The rest two equations in \eqref{eff1}-\eqref{eff3} give at the first order in $ |\omega|^2 $
\begin{align*}
%
	&
	\sum_{i}^{N-1}\, \frac{ i \Do ~+~ 2 \lgr \bsigz\,\sigo ~-~ 
					\sigo\, \frac{\ov{\displaystyle m}{}^i}{\sqrt{\displaystyle 2}}
				~+~ \text{h.c.} \rgr }
			    { 2\, \Bigl| \sigz - \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\sqrt{\displaystyle 2}} \Bigr|^2 }
			~~=~~ 0\,,
	\\[2mm]
%
	&
	\frac{1}{4\pi}\, \sum_i^{N-1}\, \frac{i \Do}
				    {2\,\Bigl( \bsigz - \frac{\displaystyle\ov{m}{}^i}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} \Bigr) }
			~~=~~ 2\, \sigz\,.
\end{align*}

	The solution to these equations are given by
\begin{align}
%
\notag
	n & ~~=~~ 0 \,,  \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad i \Dz ~~=~~ 0\,,
	\\[3mm]
%
\label{strongeq}
	i \Do & ~~=~~ 8\pi \cdot \frac{ 2\sigz } 
			{\displaystyle \sum_{i}^{N-1} 
				\frac{1}{ \bsigz - \ov{m}{}^i/\sqrt{2}} } \,,
	\qquad\qquad\qquad i ~=~ 1,...\, N-1\,,
	\\[-8mm]
%
\notag
	\sigo & \cdot \sum_{i}^{N-1} \frac{1}
			{ \sigz - \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle\sqrt{2}} }
		~+~ \text{h.c.} ~~=~~
	-\, 8\pi \cdot \sigz \cdot 
	\frac{ \displaystyle \sum_{i}^{N-1} 
			\frac{1}{ \Bigl| \sigz - \frac{\displaystyle m^i}{\displaystyle\sqrt{2}} \Bigr|^2 } }
	  { \displaystyle \sum_{i}^{N-1} 
				\frac{1}{ \bsigz - \frac{\displaystyle \ov{m}{}^i}
							{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} } }\,.
\end{align}

	We use the following relations to simplify the above solution in the case when the masses 
	are distributed on a circle,
\begin{align*}
%
	&
	\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \frac{1} { 1 \,-\, \alpha\,e^{\frac{2\pi i k}{N}} } ~~=~~
		\frac{N}{1 ~-~ \alpha^N}\,,
	\\
%
	&
	\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \frac{1} { (1 + \alpha^2) ~-~ 2\,\alpha \cos \frac{2 \pi k}{N} }
		~~=~~
	\frac{1} {1 \,-\, \alpha^2} 
	\lgr \frac{2\,N}{ 1 \,-\, \alpha^N } ~-~ N \rgr .
\end{align*}

	This gives,
\begin{align*}
%
	& 
	\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \frac{ 1 }
		{ \sigz - \frac{\displaystyle m^k}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} } ~~=~~ 
		 - \, \frac{ 1 }
		{ \sigz - \frac{\displaystyle m}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} } ~+~
		N\, \frac{\wt{\Lambda}{}^N}{\Lambda^N}\, \frac{1}{\sigz} \,,
	\\
%
	&
	\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \frac{ 1 }
                { \Bigl| \sigz - \frac{\displaystyle m^k}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} \Bigr|^2 } ~~=~~
	-\, \frac{1}
	{ \Bigl| \sigz - \frac{\displaystyle m}{\displaystyle \sqrt{2}} \Bigr|^2 } 
	~+~
	\frac{2\,N}{ \wt{\Lambda}{}^2 - m^2 } \cdot
	\frac{ \wt{\Lambda}{}^N + m^N } { \Lambda^N }\,.
\end{align*}

	In fact we will only need the leading-N contribution from them above relations.
	In particular, if we substitute these relations into Eq.~\eqref{strongeq} directly,
	we will not have $ iD $ real.
	The reason {\it perhaps} is that the $ \sigz $ solution is only valid up to $ O(1/N) $
	contributions.
	Therefore, we ignore the O(1) contributions versus O(N).
\begin{align*}
%
	i \Do & ~~=~~ \frac{16\pi}{N}\, \frac{\Lambda^N}{\wt{\Lambda}{}^N}\, |\sigz|^2\,,
	\\[3mm]
%
	| \sigo | & ~~=~~
	-\, \frac{8\pi}{N}\, \frac{\Lambda^N}{\wt{\Lambda}{}^N}\,
		\frac{ \wt{\Lambda}{}^3 } {\wt{\Lambda}{}^2 - m^2 }\,
		\Bigl[ 1 ~+~ \frac{m^N}{\wt{\Lambda}{}^N} \Bigr] \cdot
		\Bigl( \cos \bigl( \frac{2\pi l }{N} - \varphi \bigr) \Bigr)^{-1}\,,
\end{align*}
	where $ \varphi $ is the arbitrary phase of $ \sigo $.
	We can choose this phase to be the same as that of $ \sigz $, 
\[
	\varphi ~~\equiv~~ \frac{2\pi l}{N}
\]
	for the cosine to disappear.
	If we take the limit of small masses
\[
	\frac{m^N}{\Lambda^N} ~~\ll~~ 1\,,
\]
	and also note that
\[
	\wt{\Lambda} ~~=~~ \Lambda 
\]
	with exponential accuracy in $ 1/N $,
	we can further simplify the result, and arrive at
\begin{align*}
%
	n & ~~=~~ 0 
	\\[3mm]
%
	i D &  ~~=~~ u\, \Lambda^2 ~+~ \ldots \,, 
	\qquad\qquad\qquad \text{for }\frac{m^N}{\Lambda^N} ~\ll~ 1\,,
	\\[3mm]
%
	\sqrt{2}\sigma & ~~=~~ \Lambda \cdot e^{\frac{2\pi i l}{N}} \left[1
			~-~ \frac{u}{2}\, 
				\frac{\Lambda^2}{\Lambda^2 - m^2}\,\right]
	\,.
\end{align*}

where
\beq
u\equiv \frac{8\pi}{N}\,|\omega|^2
\label{u}
\eeq	
Note that although $ |\omega|^2 $ grows as $ O(N) $ for large $N$, the coefficients of 
	$|\omega|^2$-corrections are suppressed by the corresponding power of $ 1/N $ so that 
	the corrections are neutral in $ N $.

\section{ Heterotic \cpn model at large  deformations}
\setcounter{equation}{0}



Now we study equations (\ref{eff1})-(\ref{eff3}) in the limit of large values of 
deformation parameter $u\gg 1$. We will see that our theory has three different phases 
separated by two phase transitions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Strong coupling phase  with broken $Z_N$
symmetry at small $m$
\item  Coulomb/confining $Z_N$-symmetric
phase at intermediate $m$ ( coupling  is also strong in this phase) 
\item Higgs phase
at large $m$, where $Z_N$ symmetry is again broken
\end{itemize}
 We assume that masses are distributed on a circle,
see (\ref{two}).

\begin{center}
{\bf Strong coupling phase with broken $Z_N$}
\end{center}

This phase occurs at very small masses,
\beq
m\le \Lambda\,e^{-u/2}
\label{scphmass}
\eeq
In this phase we have 
\beq
|n|=0,\qquad 2\beta_{\rm ren}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\, 
\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\ln\, {\frac{iD +|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2}{\Lambda^2}} =0.
\label{scphn}
\eeq
As we will see below $\sigma$ is exponentially small in this phase. Masses are also
small. Then the second equation here gives
\beq
iD\approx \Lambda^2.
\label{scphD}
\eeq

With this value of $iD$ equation (\ref{eff3}) can be written as
\beq
 \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\left(\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i\right)\ln\, {\frac{\Lambda^2}{|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2}}
=N\left(\sqrt{2}\sigma\right)u
\label{scpheq3}
\eeq

To solve this equation we use the following trick. The "potential of a charged circle" 
of radius $m$ in 
two dimensions with the center at the origin calculated at the point in the two dimensional plane, represented by a complex  variable  $x$ reads
\beq
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\ln\, {|x-m_i|^2}
=\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\ln\,{|x|^2},\;\;\;\;\; |x|>m\\
\ln\,{m^2},\;\;\;\;\;\; |x|<m
\end{array}
\right.
\label{chargedcircle}
\eeq
in the large $N$-limit. Integrating this formula with respect to $x$ we find
\beq
 \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\left(\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i\right)\ln\, {\frac{\Lambda^2}{|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2}}
=\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\sqrt{2}\sigma\,\ln\, {\frac{\Lambda^2}{|\sqrt{2}\sigma|^2}},\;\;\;\;\;\;\; |\sqrt{2}\sigma|>m\\
\sqrt{2}\sigma\,\left(\ln\, {\frac{\Lambda^2}{m^2}}-1\right),\;\;\;\;\;\; |\sqrt{2}\sigma|<m
\end{array}
\right.
\label{usefulformula}
\eeq

Substituting this equation in (\ref{scpheq3}) at small $m$, $m<|\sqrt{2}\sigma|$ we get
\beq
\sqrt{2}\langle \sigma\rangle=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{N}k}\;\Lambda\,e^{-u/2},\qquad k=0,...,(N-1).
\label{scphsigma}
\eeq
The vacuum value of $\sigma$ is exponentially small at large $u$. The bound $m<|\sqrt{2}\sigma|$
translates into the condition (\ref{scphmass}) for  $m$. 

We see that we have $N$ degenerate vacua in this phase. The  chiral $Z_{2N}$ symmetry is broken
down to $Z_2$, the order parameter is $\langle \sigma\rangle$. Moreover, the absolute value of $\sigma$ in these vacua does not depend on $m$.
In fact this solution coincides with the one obtained in \cite{SYhet} for $m=0$. This phase
is quite similar to the strong coupling phase of \ntwot \cpn model, see (\ref{22sigmaapp}).
The difference is that the absolute value of $\sigma$ depends now on $u$ and becomes exponentially
small in the limit $u\gg 1$.


\begin{center}
{\bf Coulomb/confining phase}
\end{center}

Now we increase $m$ beyond the bound (\ref{scphmass}). From (\ref{usefulformula}) we see that the 
exponentially small solution to Eq.~(\ref{scpheq3}) no longer exist. The only solution is
\beq
\langle \sigma\rangle=0.
\label{confsigma}
\eeq
We also have
\beq
|n|=0,\qquad iD= \Lambda^2-m^2
\label{confnD}
\eeq
as follows from (\ref{scphn}).

This solution shows that we have only one $Z_N$ symmetric vacuum now. All other vacua are lifted
and become quasivacua (metastable at large $N$). This phase is quite similar to the Coulomb/confining phase
of non-supersymmetric \cpn model found by Witten \cite{W79} at zero masses. Presence 
of small splitting between quasivacua produces a linear rising confining potential between kinks
which interpolates between, say, true vacuum and the lowest quasivacuum \cite{GSY05}
see also review \cite{SYrev}.
As we already mentioned this linear potential was also interpreted as a Coulomb interaction
long time ago \cite{Coleman,W79}, see  next section for a more detailed discussion.

As soon as we have a phase with broken $Z_N$ symmetry at small $m$ and $Z_N$ symmetric phase at
intermediate $m$ we have a phase transition separating these phases. Usually one does not have phase transitions in supersymmetric theories. However, in the model at hand the supersymmetry is
badly broken ( in fact it is broken already at the classical level) therefore the emergence of 
a phase transition is not too much surprising. 

We can calculate the vacuum energy to see  the supersymmetry breaking explicitly.
Substituting (\ref{confsigma}) and (\ref{confnD}) into the effective potential (\ref{Veff})
we get
\beq
E_{vac}=\frac{N}{4\pi}\large[ \Lambda^2-m^2+m^2\ln {\frac{m^2}{\Lambda^2}}\large].
\label{confEvac}
\eeq
We plot the vacuum energy vs. $m$ in Fig.~\ref{figvacE}.

Now observe that although positive at generic values of $m$ the vacuum energy vanishes
at $m=\Lambda$. This is a signal of \ntwoo supersymmetry restoration. To check this conclusion we can
compare masses of boson $n^i$ and its fermion superpartner $\xi^i$. From (\ref{bee31}) we see that difference of 
their masses equals to $iD$. Now (\ref{confnD}) shows that $iD$ vanishes precisely at $m=\Lambda$.

Thus we see an amazing phenomenon: while \ntwoo supersymmetry was broken at the classical level
it gets restored at the quantum level at the particular point in the parameter space. 
Condition $|m|=\Lambda$ shows that we are precisely at the \ntwoo descendant of the \ntwot 
Argyres-Douglas point (\ref{ADpoint}). \ntwoo supersymmetry gets restored at the Argyres-Douglas point.
This  observation
was  first made in \cite{Tonghetdyn} using a Veneziano-Yankielowicz-type superpotential for  \ntwot \cpn model \cite{AdDVecSal,ChVa,W93}  extrapolated to the \ntwoo supersymmetric case.



\begin{center}
{\bf Higgs phase}
\end{center}

The Higgs phase occurs in our model at large $m$. As we show below the model goes into the Higgs phase at
\beq
m>\sqrt{u}\Lambda
\label{Hphmass}
\eeq
and we keep $u$ large.
In this phase $|n|$ develop VEV. From Eq.~(\ref{eff2}) we see that
\beq
iD=-|\sqrt{2}\sigma -m_0|.
\label{HphD}
\eeq

First we  study equations (\ref{eff1})-(\ref{eff3}) at $m\gg \sqrt{u}\Lambda$. 
In this regime we can drop the second logarithmic term in (\ref{eff3}). The first
term is much larger because it is   proportional to $\beta_{\rm ren}$ which is large in the quasiclassical region. Then Eq.~(\ref{eff3}) reduces to
\beq
(\sqrt{2}\sigma -m_0)\,2\beta_{\rm ren}+\frac{N}{4\pi}\,u\,\sqrt{2}\sigma =0,
\eeq
which at large $u$  gives
\beq
\sqrt{2}\sigma=\left(\frac{8\pi}{N}\beta_{\rm ren}\right)\,\frac{m_{i_{0}}}{u},
\label{Hphsigma}
\eeq
where we take into account that we can have nonzero VEV for any $n^{i_0}$, $i_0=0,...,(N-1)$.
Thus we have $N$ degenerative vacua again. In each of them $\sigma$ is small ($\sim m/u$) but
nonzero. The $Z_{2N}$ chiral symmetry is again broken down to $Z_2$. Clearly the 
Higgs phase is separated form the Coulomb/confining phase (where $Z_{2N}$ is unbroken) by
a phase transition.

In each of $N$ vacua $n^{i_0}$ develop VEV,
\beq
|n^{i_0}|^2=2\beta_{\rm ren}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\, 
\sum_{i\neq i_0}\ln\, {\frac{|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_i|^2 -|\sqrt{2}\sigma-m_{i_0}|^2}{\Lambda^2}}.
\label{Hphn}
\eeq
Since $\sigma$ is small we can expand the r.h.s. in powers of $\sigma$. The leading contribution
vanishes, while calculating the contribution proportional to $\sigma$ ( given by (\ref{Hphsigma})) we
get the following equation for $\beta_{\rm ren}$
\beq
\frac{8\pi}{N}\beta_{\rm ren}- \ln{\left(\frac{8\pi}{N}\beta_{\rm ren}\right)}=\ln{\frac{m^2}{u\Lambda^2}} +
{\rm const},
\label{Hphbetaeq}
\eeq
where we can neglect constant term in the first order approximation at $m\gg \sqrt{u}\Lambda$.

This equation has two solutions at large $m$. Keeping only the larger one ( we expect $\beta$ to be large)
we get approximately
\beq
2\beta_{\rm ren}\approx \frac{N}{4\pi}\ln{\frac{m^2}{u\Lambda^2}}. 
\label{Hphbeta}
\eeq
As we reduce $m$, at $m\sim \sqrt{u}\Lambda$ two solutions of (\ref{Hphbetaeq}) coalesce and 
at smaller $m$ become complex. Since $|n^{i_0}|^2=2\beta_{\rm ren}$ is positively defined this
signals the point of a phase transition to the Coulomb/confining phase.

To determine the point of the phase transition with better accuracy we have to take into account
the logarithmic term in Eq.~(\ref{eff3})...

Calculating the vacuum energy in this phase we get
\beq
E_{\rm vac}=...
\eeq

\section{Remarks on mirror for heterotic CP(1) }



The geometric representatition of  the heterotic CP(1) model is the following deformation
of the ${\mathcal N}=(2,2)$ model \cite{SY1}:
\beqn
&&
L_{{\rm heterotic}}= 
\zeta_R^\dagger \, i\partial_L \, \zeta_R  + 
\left[\gamma \, \zeta_R  \,R\,  \big( i\,\partial_{L}\phi^{\dagger} \big)\psi_R
+{\rm H.c.}\right] -g_0^2|\gamma |^2 \left(\zeta_R^\dagger\, \zeta_R
\right)\left(R\,  \psi_L^\dagger\psi_L\right)
\nonumber
\\[4mm]
&&
+
G\, \left\{\rule{0mm}{5mm}
\partial_\mu \phi^\dagger\, \partial^\mu\phi  
+\frac{i}{2}\big(\psi_L^\dagger\!\stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{\partial_R}\!\psi_L 
+ \psi_R^\dagger\!\stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{\partial_L}\!\psi_R
\big)\right.
\nonumber
\\[4mm] 
&&
-\frac{i}{\chi}\,  \big[\psi_L^\dagger \psi_L
\big(\phi^\dagger \!\stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{\partial_R}\!\phi
\big)+ \psi_R^\dagger\, \psi_R
\big(\phi^\dagger\!\stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{\partial_L}\!\phi
\big)
\big]
-
\frac{2(1- g_0^2 |\gamma |^2)}{\chi^2}\,\psi_L^\dagger\,\psi_L \,\psi_R^\dagger\,\psi_R
\Big\}\,,
\label{AAone}
\eeqn
where the field $\zeta_R$ appearing in the first line is
the spinor field on $C$ which appears, with necessity in the ${\mathcal N}=(0,2)$ model \cite{EdTo}.
Here $G$ is the metric while $R$ is the Ricci tensor.
To begin with, we let us assume the deformation parameter $\gamma$ to be small (it is dimensionless)
and work to the leading order in $\gamma$.

Note that 
\beqn
&&
K\big|_{\theta=\bar\theta=0}=\frac{2}{g_{0}^{2}}\,\ln \chi\,, 
\nonumber
\\[2mm]
&&
G=G_{1\bar 1}=\partial_\phi\partial_{\phi^\dagger\,} 
K\big|_{\theta=\bar\theta=0}=
\frac{2}{g_{0}^2\,\chi^{2}}\,,
\nonumber
\\[2mm]
&&
\Gamma =\Gamma^{1}_{11} =- 2\, \frac{\phi^\dagger\,}{\chi}\,,\quad 
\bar\Gamma =\Gamma^{\bar 1}_{\bar 1\bar 1}=
- 2\, \frac{ \phi}{\chi}\,,
\nonumber
\\[2mm]
&&
 R \equiv  R_{1\bar 1}=-G^{-1}\!R_{1\bar 1 1\bar 1}=\frac{2}{\chi^2}\,,
\label{Atwo}
\eeqn
where the following notation
is implied:
\beq
\chi \equiv 1+\phi\,\phi^\dagger\,.
\eeq
Thus, the kinetic terms of the CP(1) fields $\phi$ and $\psi$ contain $\frac{1}{g^2}$ in the normalization
while $\gamma$ in the first line is defined in conjunction with the Ricci tensor, so that there is no $\frac{1}{g^2}$
in front of this term. This convention is important for what follows.

Now, let us remember that the undeformed CP(1) model has a mirror representation \cite{MR1,MR2}
\beq
{\mathcal L}_{\rm mirror} = \int d^4\theta\, Y^\dagger\, Y + \int d^2\theta\, {\mathcal W}_{\rm mirror}
(Y) + {\rm H.c.}
\label{five}
\eeq
where 
\beq
{\mathcal W}_{\rm mirror} = \Lambda \left( e^Y + e^{-Y}\right)\,,
\eeq
and $\Lambda$ is the dynamical scale of the CP(1) model.

The question is: ``what is the mirror representation of the deformed model (\ref{AAone}), to the leading order in $\gamma$?"

Surprisingly, this question has a very simple answer.
To find the answer let us observe that the term of the first order in $\gamma$ in (\ref{AAone})
is nothing but the superconformal anomaly in the unperturbed CP(1) model (it is sufficient to consider this anomaly in the unperturbed model since we are after the leading term in $\gamma$ in the mirror representation).
More exactly, in the CP(1) model
\beq
\gamma_\mu J^\mu_{\,\,\alpha} = -\frac{ \sqrt 2}{2\pi}\,R\, \left(\partial_\nu \phi^\dagger\right)\left(
\gamma^\nu\psi\right)_\alpha\,,
\label{six}
\eeq
where $J^\mu_{\,\,\alpha}$ is the supercurrent.
In what follows, for simplicity,  numerical factors like $2$ or $\pi$ will be omitted
This means that the deformation term in (\ref{AAone}) can be written as
\beq
\Delta {\mathcal L} = \gamma \zeta_R\left(\gamma_\mu \, J^\mu\right)_L
\label{seven}
\eeq 

Since (\ref{six}) has a geometric meaning we can readily rewrite this term in the mirror representation
(\ref{five}). Indeed, in the generalized Wess-Zumino model
\beq
\left(\gamma_\mu \, J^\mu\right)_L
 = \frac{\partial {\mathcal W}_{\rm mirror}}{\partial Y}\,\psi_L\,.
 \label{eight}
\eeq
This equation is not quite exact, but it is good enough for the time being.

Now, combining (\ref{seven}) and (\ref{eight})
we get the following deformation of ${\mathcal L}_{\rm mirror}$ (in the leading order in $\gamma$):
\beq
\Delta {\mathcal L}_{\rm mirror}= \gamma \, \zeta_R \,\psi_L\,\, \frac{\partial {\mathcal W}_{\rm mirror}}{\partial Y}
+{\rm H.c.}
\eeq

In superfields this is equivalent to adding to (\ref{five}) the following terms:
\beq
\Delta {\mathcal L}_{\rm mirror}  \int d^4\theta {\mathcal B}\, {\mathcal B}^\dagger 
+\gamma \int d\theta_L^\dagger\, \theta_L \,d\theta_L  d\theta_R\,\, {\mathcal B} \,{\mathcal W}_{\rm mirror}
+{\rm H.c.}
\eeq

This adds up to the scalar potential the term 
\beq
\Delta V = |\gamma|^2 \left|{\mathcal W}_{\rm mirror}\right|^2\,.
\eeq
Note that a constant shift in ${\mathcal W}_{\rm mirror}$
becomes an observable physical effect.

Minkowski vesrus Euclidean formulation}

Minkowski vesrus Euclidean formulation}
 \renewcommand{\theequation}{A.\arabic{equation}}
\setcounter{equation}{0}
 
 \renewcommand{\thesubsection}{A.\arabic{subsection}}
\setcounter{subsection}{0}

In the bulk of the paper we use both, Minkowski and Euclidean conventions.
It is useful to summarize the transition rules.
If the Minkowski coordinates are
\beq
x^\mu_M =\{t,\,z\}\,,
\eeq
the passage to the Euclidean space requires
\beq
t \to - i\tau\,,
\eeq
and the Euclidean coordinates are
\beq
x^\mu_M =\{\tau,\,z\}\,.
\eeq
The derivatives are defined as follows:
\beqn
\pt_L^M &=& \pt_t+\pt_z\,,\qquad \pt_R^M = \pt_t- \pt_z\,,
\nonumber\\[2mm]
\pt_L^E &=& \pt_\tau - i \pt_z\,,\qquad \pt_R^M = \pt_\tau + i \pt_z\,.
\eeqn
The Dirac spinor is
\beq
\Psi =\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\psi_R\\[1mm]
\psi_L
\end{array}
\right)
\eeq
In passing to the Eucildean space $\Psi^M = \Psi^E$;
however, $\bar\Psi$ is transformed,
\beq
\bar\Psi^M \to i \bar \Psi^E\,.
\eeq
Moreover, $\Psi^E$ and $\bar \Psi^E$ are {\em not} related by the complex conjugation operation.
They become independent variables. The fermion gamma matrices are defined as
\beq
\bar\sigma^\mu_M =\{1,\,-\sigma_3\}\,,\qquad \bar\sigma^\mu_E =\{1,\, i\sigma_3\}\,.
\eeq
Finally, 
\beq
\cell_E =- \cell_M (t=-i\tau , ...).
\eeq
With this notation, formally, the fermion kinetic terms in $\cell_E $ and $\cell_M $
coincide.
If we want the heterotic deformation term to have the same form in
$\cell_E $ and $\cell_M $ we must (and do) transform the heterotic deformation parameter as follows:
\beq
\gamma_M = i\,\gamma_E\,.
\eeq

Everywhere where there is no menace of confusion we omit the super/sub\-scripts $M,E$.
It is obvious from the context where the Euclidean or Minkowski formulation is implied.

\section*{Appendix B: \\
Global symmetries of the CP\boldmath{$(N-1)$} model with \boldmath{$Z_{N}$}-symmetric
 twisted masses}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix: \\
Global symmetries of the CP$(N-1)$ model with  $Z_N$-symmetric
 twisted masses}
 \renewcommand{\theequation}{B.\arabic{equation}}
\setcounter{equation}{0}
 
 \renewcommand{\thesubsection}{B.\arabic{subsection}}
\setcounter{subsection}{0}

Now let us discuss global symmetries of this model. In the absence of the twisted masses
the model was SU$(N)$ symmetric. The twisted masses (\ref{spch}) explicitly break this symmetry down to U$(1)^{N-1}$,
\beqn
n^\ell&\to& e^{i\alpha_\ell}n^\ell\,,\quad \xi^\ell_R \to e^{i\alpha_\ell}\xi^\ell_R\,
\quad \xi^\ell_L \to e^{i\alpha_\ell}\xi^\ell_L\,,\quad \ell=1,2, ..., N\,,
\nonumber\\[2mm]
\sigma
&\to&
 \sigma\,,\quad \lambda_{R,L}\to \lambda_{R,L}\,.
\eeqn
where $\alpha_\ell$ are $N$ constant phases different for different $\ell$. 

Next, there is a global vectorial U(1) symmetry which rotates all fermions $\xi^\ell$
in one and the same way, leaving the boson fields intact,
\beqn
\xi^\ell_R 
&\to& 
e^{i\beta}\xi^\ell_R\,, \quad
 \xi^\ell_L \to e^{i\beta}\xi^\ell_L\,,\quad \ell=1,2, ..., N\,,
\nonumber\\[2mm]
\lambda_R 
&\to&
 e^{-i\beta}\lambda_R\,,\quad 
\lambda_L \to e^{-i\beta}\lambda_L\,,
\nonumber\\[2mm]
n^\ell &\to& n^\ell\,,\quad \sigma\to\sigma\,.
\eeqn

Finally, there is a discrete $Z_{2N}$ symmetry which is of most importance for our purposes.
Indeed, let us start from the axial U$(1)_R$ transformation which would be a symmetry
of the classical action at $m=0$ 
 (it is anomalous, though, under quantum corrections),
\beqn
\xi^\ell_R 
&\to& 
e^{i\gamma}\xi^\ell_R\,, \quad
 \xi^\ell_L \to e^{-i\gamma }\xi^\ell_L\,,\quad \ell=1,2, ..., N\,,
 \nonumber\\[2mm]
 \lambda_R 
&\to&
 e^{i\gamma}\lambda_R\,,\quad 
 \lambda_L \to e^{-i\gamma}\lambda_L\,,\quad \sigma \to e^{2i\gamma}\sigma\,,
\nonumber\\[2mm]
n^\ell
&\to&
 n^\ell\,.
\eeqn
With $m$ switched on and the chiral anomaly included, this transformation 
is no longer the symmetry of the model. However, a discrete $Z_{2N}$ subgroup survives both the inclusion of anomaly and $m\neq 0$. This subgroup corresponds to
\beq
\gamma_k =\frac{2\pi i k}{2N}\,,\quad k= 1,2, ..., N\,.
\eeq
with the simultaneous shift
\beq
\ell\to \ell - k\,.
\eeq
In other words,
\beqn
\xi^\ell_R 
&\to& 
e^{i\gamma_k}\xi^{\ell-k}_R\,, \quad
 \xi^\ell_L \to e^{-i\gamma_k }\xi^{\ell-k}_L\,, 
 \nonumber\\[2mm]
 \lambda_R 
&\to&
 e^{i\gamma_k}\lambda_R\,,\quad 
 \lambda_L \to e^{-i\gamma_k}\lambda_L\,,\quad \sigma \to e^{2i\gamma_k}\sigma\,,
 \nonumber\\[2mm]
 n^\ell &\to & n^{\ell-k}\,.
 \label{bee35}
\eeqn
This $Z_{2N}$ symmetry  relies on the particular choice of masses 
given in (\ref{spch}).

The order parameters for the $Z_N$ symmetry are as follows:
(i) the set of the vacuum expectation values
$\{ \langle n^1\rangle,\,\, \langle n^2\rangle, \,...\, \langle n^N\rangle\}$
and (i) the bifermion condensate $\langle  \xi^\dagger_{R,\,\ell}\xi^\ell_L\rangle$.
Say, a nonvanishing value of $\langle n^1\rangle$ or  $\langle  \xi^\dagger_{R,\,\ell}\xi^\ell_L\rangle$ implies that the $Z_{2N}$ symmetry of the action is broken down to
$Z_2$. The first order parameter is more convenient for detection
at large $m$ while the second at small $m$. 

It is instructive to illustrate the above conclusions
in a different formulation of the sigma model, namely, in the geometrical formulation
(for simplicity we will consider CP(1); generalization to CP$(N-1)$ is straightforward).
In components the Lagrangian of the model is
\beqn
&&
{\mathcal L}_{\,  CP(1)}= G\, \Big\{
\partial_\mu \bar{\phi}\, \partial^\mu\phi -|m|^2{\bar{\phi}\,\phi} 
+\frac{i}{2}\big(\psi_L^\dagger\!\stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{\partial_R}\!\psi_L 
+ \psi_R^\dagger\!\stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{\partial_L}\!\psi_R
\big)
\nonumber\\[1mm] 
&&
-i\,\frac{1-\bar{\phi}\,\phi}{\chi} \,\big(m\,\psi_L^\dagger \psi_R + \bar m
\psi_R^\dagger \psi_L
\big)
\nonumber\\[1mm] 
&&
-\frac{i}{\chi}\,  \big[\psi_L^\dagger \psi_L
\big(\bar{\phi} \!\stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{\partial_R}\!\phi
\big)+ \psi_R^\dagger\, \psi_R
\big(\bar{\phi}\!\stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{\partial_L}\!\phi
\big)
\big]
\nonumber\\[1mm]
&&
-
\frac{2}{\chi^2}\,\psi_L^\dagger\,\psi_L \,\psi_R^\dagger\,\psi_R
\Big\}\,,
\label{Aone}
\eeqn
where 
\beq
\chi = 1+\bar{\phi}\,\phi\,,\quad G= \frac{2}{g_0^2\,\chi^2}\,.
\eeq
The $Z_2$ transformation corresponding to (\ref{bee35}) is
\beq
\phi \to -\frac{1}{\bar{\phi}}\,,\qquad \psi_R^\dagger \psi_L\to -
\psi_R^\dagger \psi_L\,.
\label{bee40}
\eeq
 The order parameter which can detect breaking/nonbreaking of the above
symmetry is
\beq
\frac{m}{g_0^2} \left(1- \frac{g_0^2}{2\pi}
\right)\, \frac{\bar{\phi}\,\phi-1}{\bar{\phi}\,\phi+1} - 
i R \psi_R^\dagger \psi_L\,.
\eeq
Under the transformation (\ref{bee40}) this order parameter changes sign.
In fact, this is  the central charge of the \ntwo
sigma model, including the anomaly  \cite{svz}.

Now, what changes if instead of the \ntwo model we will consider nonsupersymmetric 
CP$(N-1)$ model with twisted masses? Then the part of the Lagrangian (\ref{bee31}) containing fermions must be dropped. The same must be done in the $Z_2$ order parameter.
As was shown in~\cite{GSY05,GSYphtr}, now at $m>\Lambda$ the $Z_2$ symmetry is broken, while at $m<\Lambda$ unbroken. A phase transition takes place.
